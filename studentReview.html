            <p>                <em>A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
                I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student.
                I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of 
                February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The 
                trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They 
                teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming 
                languages from scratch.
                
                I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at
                Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for
                students from all domains to understand the concepts and
                technology taught by the trainers.
                
                Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a
                package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in
                securing this job.
                
                Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me
                acquire this opportunity.</em></p></pre>

<pre><em>            After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming
                skills, and my knowledge of core Java has also improved. Now,
                I am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS
                in parallel.

                Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving
                skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the
                recorded videos. They also provide recorded videos of
                frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.
                
                I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of
                Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.
                
                Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.

                     decisions for my educational and professional growth. The 
                     institute offers a holistic learning environment that caters to
                     various aspects of my development as a student and aspiring

                     I faced challenges, I knew I could rely on my instructors to offer
                     guidance and support, making the learning process smoother and more 
                     enjoyable.
                    
                     One of the standout features of TAP Academy is the TAI
                     platform, dedicated to coding practice. This platform has been
                     instrumental in enhancing my programming skills. LMS at TAP
                     Academy is another great asset. It centralizes all learning 
                     materials, assignments, and progress tracking in one place.The
                     dedicated job portal connects students with potential employers,
                     offering a direct pathway to internships and job placements. Through
                     this portal, I have had the opportunity to apply my skills in a 
                     professional setting, which has been crucial for my career development.

                and selected students for their CSR batch, offering a free course that's

                and provide in-depth coverage of programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable 
                for placement opportunities. I'm grateful to have been selected by Avasoft with 
                the role of Trainee Engineer with a package of 5 LPA through college placement, 
                and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible teaching, as I used the 
                same approach they taught me during them mock interview process. Additionally, 
                Tap Academy offers comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an LMS platform
